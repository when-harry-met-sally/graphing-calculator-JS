# Graphing Calculator

First project as a QTP internship. The original project was to create a simple calculator. The first version tried to mimic a standard Mac calculator and proved trickier than expect. Most interns started to use the JS eval function which eased things.

This is a simple and incomplete graphing calculator. I would change many things in hindsight. Using a canvas would likely be the first.
